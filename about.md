My name is Garrett Campbell and I'm a Senior Software Engineer! I really enjoy doing all things technology. I love to learn new things and building projects that I can use! I've worked on developer tools, embedded systems, simulators, etc. However, I find just about anything interesting and hope to showcase that in this blog. 

Outside of work I love fitness, sports, cheering on Virginia Tech (GO HOKIES), puzzles, and anything where I can spend time with friends/family and learn something new!
